            <h2>Our Believes</h2>
			<h3>Version - 1</h3>
            <p>Does it really matter what a church’s leadership believes and teaches? Absolutely. Jesus came up with the idea of a “church” and has a unique purpose and mission for us to fulfill. So, it’s extremely important that we, as a church, believe, teach, and live out the truth that Jesus taught and endorsed. So, if you’re a believer seeking to connect with a church family and are considering membership, a church’s doctrinal beliefs are the first and most important factor in your decision.</p>
			<p>We wanted to be able to convey what we believe in two ways. First, we offer a “short version” that captures not only what we believe, but why it’s important to us. And second, we offer a “detailed version” that is purposely more technical and more detailed because, when it comes to doctrine, precision and clarity matter deeply. So, read the short version, and study the second…</p>
			<h4>Short Version</h4>
            <p>God is real. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and totally in charge of the direction history is moving. He is Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He created everything and everyone and every person matters deeply to him. Everyone has sinned, so everyone needs Jesus, who died for our sins, rose again from the dead, and is coming back. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Jesus Christ alone, and once you’re saved, you’re always saved.</p>
			<p>Heaven and hell are real, as are angels and demons, including Satan. The Holy Spirit lives in every believer and empowers and gifts us to live and serve. The Bible, which is God’s Word, is both true and powerful. Baptism is when believers are immersed in water, not for salvation but to tell the world we follow Jesus. Communion is a memorial to Jesus’ death. Jesus started the church before His death, protects it through every age, and commissioned the church to tell the world about Him. And no matter what, there is always hope.</p>
			<h4>Detailed Version</h4>
			<h5>God</h5>
			<p>God is the creator and ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three persons – the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God.</p>
			<p><i>Genesis 1:1, 26, 27; 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19; 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Corinthians 13:14</i></p>
			<h5>Man</h5>
			<p>Man is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like him in character. He is the supreme object of God’s creation. Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called “sin.” This attitude separates man from God.</p>
			<p><i>Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a; Romans 3:23; Isaiah 59:1, 2</i></p>
			<h5>Eternity</h5>
			<p>Man was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is hell. To be eternally in union with him is eternal life. Heaven and hell are places of eternal existence.</p>
			<p><i>John 3:16; 1 John 2:25; 1 John 5:11-13; Romans 6:23; Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:31-46</i></p>
			<h5>Jesus Christ</h5>
			<p>Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to heaven’s glory and will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
			<p><i>Matthew 1:22, 23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5, 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14, 15; 1 Corinthians 15:3, 4; Romans 1:3, 4; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Timothy 6:14, 15; Titus 2:13</i></p>
			<h5>Salvation</h5>
			<p>Salvation is a gift from God to man. Man can never make up for his sin by self-improvement or good works – only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can man be saved from sin’s penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.</p>
			<p><i>Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8, 9; John 14:6, 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1</i></p>
			<h5>Eternal Security</h5>
			<p>Because God gives man eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian.</p>
			<p><i>John 10:29; 2 Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25; 10:10, 14; 1 Peter 1:3-5</i></p>
			<h5>Holy Spirit</h5>
			<p>The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live under his control daily.</p>
			<p><i>2 Corinthians 3:17; John 16:7-13, 14:16, 17; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:12, 3:16; Ephesians 1:13; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 5:1</i></p>
			<h5>Bible</h5>
			<p>The Bible is God’s word to all men. It was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error.</p>
			<p><i>2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20, 21; 2 Timothy 1:13; Psalm 119:105,160, 12:6; Proverbs 30:5</i></p>
			<h5>Baptism</h5>
			<p>Baptism by immersion symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus and is your public declaration that you have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. Baptism does not save you, but shows the world that you have already been saved. And while baptism is not required for salvation, it is a biblical command and demonstrates your love and obedience to Christ.</p>
			<p><i>Colossians 2:12; Acts 2:41; Ephesians 2: 8-9; Matthew 28:19-20</i></p>
			<h5>Communion</h5>
			<p>Communion, or the Lord’s Supper, is an ordinance given to all believers by Jesus Christ to remember his sacrifice for us and to symbolize the new covenant. The elements of bread and wine or juice are symbols of Christ’s broken body and shed blood. Communion is not a means of salvation. Rather, it is a testament of a believer’s faith in the atoning work of the cross.</p>
			<h3>Version - 2</h3>
			<h5>Bible</h5>
			<p>The Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, are the inspired Word of God without error in the original writings and are the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men, and the divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life.</p>
			<h5>God</h5>
			<p>There is one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect, and eternally existing in three manifestations: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
			<h5>Jesus Christ</h5>
			<p>Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the cross, the complete and final sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. Further, He arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where, at the right hand of God, He is now our High Priest and Advocate.</p>
			<h5>The Holy Spirit</h5>
			<p>The ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ and during this age, to convict men of sin, regenerate the believing sinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living and service.</p>
			<h5>Man</h5>
			<p>Man was created in the image of God but fell into sin and is therefore lost, and only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual life be obtained.</p>
			<h5>Salvation</h5>
			<p>The shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provide the only ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only such as receive Jesus Christ by faith are born of the Holy Spirit and thus become children of God.</p>
			<h5>The Return of the Jesus Christ</h5>
			<p>The personal, premillennial, and imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ is our hope and has a vital bearing on the personal life and service of the believer.</p>
			<h5>Future Events</h5>
			<p>There will be a bodily resurrection of all the dead; of the believer to everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord, and of the unbeliever to judgment and everlasting conscious punishment.</p>
			<h5>Church</h5>
			<p>The true Church is composed of all such persons, who through saving faith in Jesus Christ, have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ of which He is the head.</p>
			<h5>Baptism and Communion</h5>
			<p>Water baptism by immersion soon after accepting Christ as personal Savior, is a testimony of death to sin and resurrection to a new life. The Lord’s Supper is a memorial service setting forth in sacred and symbolic manner the death of the Lord Jesus Christ; all true believers and only believers should share in it.</p>
